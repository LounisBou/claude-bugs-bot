"""One question at a time per person (spec § 3.5): a question to someone who owes an answer on another report waits on their card.

A person may raise several subjects; the agent works on all of them but asks about one at a time, so
nobody faces a volley of questions. ``reply --awaits`` to a person whose answer is awaited on another
report not done posts nothing: the question joins ``questions`` on their card. Once nothing of theirs is
awaited — they answered, or the awaited message was deleted — ``wait`` prints ``ask <report-id>`` for
the oldest one, and the agent asks it from the current state of that subject.
